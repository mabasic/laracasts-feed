# Laracasts Feed 

> XML Feed to JSON Feed

**URL:** `laracasts-feed.mariobasic.com/api/v1/feed`

## Description

**This application fetched the Laracasts XML RSS feed and converts it to JSON format. By doing so I can fetch the feed with React.js in my latest chrome extension.**

> I found this to be a quick workaround, but then realized that I need it anyway.
